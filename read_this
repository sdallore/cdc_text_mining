Hi Dani, 

I don't seem to have push access to this repo, so I branched it and saved one in my github.

Here is what I did so far:
  1) pulled in the data and did a little EDA, but not as much as you
  2) ran the text column through a couple text libraries in python
      a) count vectors
      b) tf_idf
      c) tf_idf_ngram_vectors
      d) word tokenising
      
if you can run the python script and repoint the data imports to your files, you can see all the files.

If that's not feasible right now, I will try to upload the csv of the tokenised output.  I haven't run any models on it, except NB Multinomial, but it 
was abyssmal.

I will keep working on it, but I think this is a good direction to go with the features.

Scott
